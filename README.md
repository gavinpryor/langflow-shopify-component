# Langflow Shopify Component
1. Triggers Shopify Component job in Keboola project
2. Exports resulting data and pulls into Langflow

# Notes
+ test_file performs operations correctly, but there is no way (to my knowledge) to use unsupported python packages in langflow, so installing the kbcstorage client doesn't work
